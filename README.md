# 3D_reconstruction
Algorithm for 3d reconstruction from rotational image sequence

As input our algorithm requires a rotational binary-image sequence with known rotational angle, and calibration parameters for the imaging system.

## Dependencies

* `libpng`
* `libpng-dev`.

## Building from source

```bash
# Build binary
make
# Install
make install
```
